## Question
Why is a **Subscription ID** required to access or manage any resource in Microsoft Azure?

## Answer
A **Subscription ID** in Azure uniquely identifies your subscription and is required to manage or access resources because it links your account to billing, permissions, and resource usage. Every resource you create in Azure belongs to a subscription, so Azure uses the Subscription ID to track ownership, enforce access control via role-based access, and calculate costs accurately.
